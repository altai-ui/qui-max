# What is Quimax?

Qui Max is a component's library helping us build great products. After some time using inside our company's projects, we decided to publish it in open source to get some feedback and help frontend developers make user interfaces faster.

To see how it works, we've made a [Storybook (live demo)](https://qvant-lab.github.io/qui-max/).

This library written on Typescript for Vue 3 with Composition API. But also we have Qui for Vue 2.x [here](https://github.com/Qvant-lab/qui)!

## How It Works

To use Qui Max you need to install it to your [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) project via your preferred package manager. Let's check out how to [setup Qui Max](/guide/getting-started.html#quick-setup).
